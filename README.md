A finger on the pulse Maybe the time is going on it’s not right for your business to harness the value of AI. Although, doesn’t mean you should stop keeping up like others are using AI. Only reading IT journal trade is a good place to start. Rather start focusing on how businesses are leveraging AI. Piggyback on the innovators To implement AI, there are so many resources present from an industry that will help you. For example Google has developed a machine learning system, TensorFlow. That has released as open source software. Brainstorm potential uses with your team If you want, a team must be engaged in encouraging in the areas of business, AI could be deployed. Data-heavy, inefficient are processes that are likely benefit. Moreover, find where these exist. Start small and focus on creating real value It’s not mandatory to move forward for the sake only. Rather, it’s necessary to focus on objectives and start finding the best solution for it. Moreover, mean finding the specific process to run AI pilot.

<b><h4><code>Q.22. What is Single Agent Pathfinding Problems? </code></h4></b>

There are different types of games. Such as 3X3 eight-tile, 4X4 fifteen-tilepuzzles are single-agent-path-finding challenges. As they are consisting of a matrix of tiles with a blank tile. Thus, to arrange the tiles by sliding a tile either vertically or horizontally into a blank space. Also, with the aim of accomplishing some objective. 

<b><h4><code>Q.23. Name search algorithm technology? </code></h4></b>

1. Problem Space Basically, it is the environment in which the search takes place. (A set of states and set of operators to change those states)
2. Problem Instance It is a result of Initial state + Goal state.
3. Problem Space Graph We use it to represent problem state. Also, we use nodes to show states.
4. The depth of a problem We can define a length of the shortest path. 

<b><h4><code>Q.24. What Brute-Force Search Strategies? </code></h4></b>

This strategy doesn’t require any domain-specific knowledge. Thus it’s so simple strategy. Hence, it works very smoothly and fine with a small number of possible states. 

1. Requirements for Brute Force Algorithms
2. State description
3. A set of valid operators
4. Initial state
5. Goal state description 

<b><h4><code>Q.25. What is Breadth-First Search Algorithm? </code></h4></b>

Basically, we have to start searching for the root node. And continue through neighboring nodes first. Further, moves towards next level of nodes. Moreover, till the solution is found, generates one tree at a time. As this search can be implemented using FIFO queue data structure. This method provides the shortest path to the solution. FIFO(First in First Out). If the branching factor (average number of child nodes for a given node) = b and depth = d, the number of nodes at level d = bd. The total no of nodes created in worst case is b + b2 + b3 + … + bd. 

<b><h4><code>Q.26. What is Depth-First Search Algorithm? </code></h4></b>
It is based on the concept of LIFO. As it stands for Last In First Out. Also, implemented in recursion with LIFO stack data structure. Thus, It used to create the same set of nodes as the Breadth-First method, only in the different order. As the path is been stored in each iteration from root to leaf node. Thus, store nodes are linear with space requirement. With branching factor b and depth as m, the storage space is bm. 

<b><h4><code>Q.27 What is Bidirectional Search Algorithm? </code></h4></b>
Basically, starts searches forward from an initial state and backward from goal state. As till both meets to identify a common state. Moreover, initial state path is concatenated with the goal state inverse path. Each search is done only up to half of the total path. 

<b><h4><code>Q.28. What is the Uniform Cost Search Algorithm? </code></h4></b>
Basically, it performs sorting in increasing the cost of the path to a node. Also, always expands the least cost node. Although, it is identical to Breadth-First search if each transition has the same cost. It explores paths in the increasing order of cost. 

<b><h4><code>Q.29. What is Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search Algorithm? </code></h4></b>
To perform this search we need to follow steps. As it performs the DFS starting to level 1, starts and then executes a complete depth-first search to level 2. Moreover, we have to continue searching process till we find the solution. We have to generate nodes till single nodes are created. Also, it saves only stack of nodes. As soon as he finds a solution at depth d, the algorithm ends, The number of nodes created at depth d is bd and at depth d-1 is bd-1. 

<b><h4><code>Q.30. What are disadvantages Uniform Cost Search Algorithm? </code></h4></b>
There can be multiple long paths with the cost ≤ C*. Uniform Cost search must explore them all
